        <p>This mushroom soup is creamy and rich — it's one of my favorite soups of all time and it's so easy! The long, slow caramelization of the mushrooms requires a little patience, but it really unlocks their magical flavor, which is the secret to this mushroom soup.</p>

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>¼ cup unsalted butter</li>
            <li>2 (16 ounce) packages sliced fresh mushrooms</li>
            <li>1 pinch salt</li>
            <li>1 medium yellow onion, diced</li>
            <li>1 ½ tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>6 sprigs fresh thyme, tied in a bundle with kitchen twine</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, peeled</li>
            <li>4 cups chicken broth, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup water, or more to taste</li>
            <li>1 cup heavy whipping cream</li>
            <li>1 salt and freshly ground black pepper to taste</li>
